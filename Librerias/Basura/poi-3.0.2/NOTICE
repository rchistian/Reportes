A single data file of the POI component HDGF is based on VSDump,
 and is under the GNU General Public Licence version 3 (GPL v3):

Since this is a data file, and has no compiled version (the original
 file is distributed in both source and binary versions), there should
 be little difference in licencing requirements compared to the ASL.
